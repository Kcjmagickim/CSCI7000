HelloJS&HTML - Utilized JavaScript and HTML to create a website with hierarchical graphic effects

Brief:
    Assignment3.html: tracks user's mouse cursor and creates a trail of bears chasing the mouse pointer. 
        A bear leads four pandas (hierarchical movement where pandas depend on their leader bear).
	Also utilized a cool CSS animation to make website title constantly change color in rainbow.
    bear.html: image of a bear drawn using basic JS built in functions
    bear.png: image in bear.html with background removed
    panda.html: image of a panda bear drawn using basic JS built in functions
    bear.png: image in panda.html with background removed
