All the .apk files reside in the Builds directory.
Step 4 is called "HelloCardBoard". Step 5 is "HelloTarget" and step 6 is "HelloGame"
HelloGame is my version of Chrome Dino. Instead of a dinosaur, we have a ball on a grass lane, hopping over endless stream of trees
Tree is generated every two seconds. If ball hits the tree, GG.
Enjoy!
